# Splash Screen Assets and Android Root Hint

## Splash Screen Web Assets
- HTML:  simple-recipe-browser-30180-30189/flutter_frontend/assets/splash-screen-9-385.html
- CSS:   simple-recipe-browser-30180-30189/flutter_frontend/assets/splash-screen-9-385.css
- JS:    simple-recipe-browser-30180-30189/flutter_frontend/assets/splash-screen-9-385.js
- Images: simple-recipe-browser-30180-30189/flutter_frontend/assets/figmaimages/

Open the HTML directly in a browser for verification.

## Android/Kotlin Project Root (for external analyzers)
- Android root: simple-recipe-browser-30180-30189/flutter_frontend/android

If your analyzer cannot detect this automatically:
- Set PROJECT_ROOT to the path above, or
- Run `./print_android_root.sh` from the repository root to emit the path.

These steps are provided to help external tooling and do not affect the generated web assets.
