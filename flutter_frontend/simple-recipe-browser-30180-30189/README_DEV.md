Flutter project root:

- Path: simple-recipe-browser-30180-30189/flutter_frontend
- Contains: pubspec.yaml, android/, lib/, assets/

Run commands from that directory, e.g.:
  cd simple-recipe-browser-30180-30189/flutter_frontend
  flutter pub get
  flutter build apk

Note: Static HTML/CSS/JS assets generated for design previews are placed under:
  simple-recipe-browser-30180-30189/flutter_frontend/assets/
These do not affect Flutter build outputs.
